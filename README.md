Computer Vision Final Project: Classification
=============================================

This project focuses on the classification of images by means of SIFT features and the training of an artificial neural network (ANN). Five classes from the Caltech 101 dataset were chosen for training and classification in the ANN. Based on the classification results, conclusions will be made about using SIFT features, training the neural network, and the effectiveness of the combination of the two.
